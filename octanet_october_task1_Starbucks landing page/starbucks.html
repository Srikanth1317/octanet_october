                    Our Heritage
Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market.
 It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around 
 the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring 
 tradition of the early coffee traders. <br>
 <br>

Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through
 these doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982,
  a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. 
  It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle 
  inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones
   and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse. <br>
   <br>


Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and 
New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and 
China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a
 part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always 
 dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every community -
  we nurture the limitless possibilities of human <connection class="br">

Coffee & Craft
It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee cherries, 
to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the barista who serves it with care.
 We are committed to the highest standards of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to
  create new experiences to savor.
